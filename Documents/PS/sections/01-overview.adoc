== Overview
This document has been produced by the IHO Nautical Information Provision Working Group
(NIPWG) in response to a requirement to produce a data product that can be used as a Nautical
Publication Information Overlay (NPIO) within an Electronic Chart Display and Information
Systems (ECDIS). It is based on the IHO S-100 framework specification and the ISO 19100 series
of standards. It is a vector product specification that is primarily intended for encoding the extent
and nature of Marine Protected Areas, for navigational purposes.

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) identifies certain categories of
Marine Protected Areas which may require higher standards of environmental protection. Article
194(5) places an obligation on parties to take measures necessary to protect and preserve rare
or fragile ecosystems. Part IX of UNCLOS identifies enclosed or semi-enclosed areas, such as a
gulf, bay, basin or sea between two or more countries, as places where countries shall endeavor
to coordinate the management of environmental protection activities. In respect of Particularly
Sensitive Sea Areas (PSSA), Article 211(6)(a) UNCLOS makes provision for a State to submit to
the “competent international organization” (IMO for shipping), special mandatory measures
concerning the protection from vessel sourced pollution.

UNCLOS thus creates an overall structure for the protection and preservation of the marine
environment and places a general obligation on States to implement global conventions
addressing particular forms of pollution protection and regional agreements tailored to the
requirements of discrete sea areas.

=== Terms, definitions and abbreviations

==== Use of language

Within this document:

* "`Must`" indicates a mandatory requirement.
* "`Should`" indicates an optional requirement, that is the recommended process to be followed, but is not mandatory.
* "`May`" means "`allowed to`" or "`could possibly`" and is not mandatory.


==== Terms and definitions

===== Accuracy

Closeness of agreement between a test result and the accepted reference values.

NOTE: A test result can be from an observation or measurement.

===== Coordinate

One of a sequence of _n_ numbers designating the position of a point in N-dimensional space.

NOTE: The numbers must be qualified by units and CRS.

===== Coordinate Reference System

*Coordinate* system which is related to the real world by a datum.

===== Coverage

*Feature* that acts as a function to return values from its range for any direct position within its spatial, temporal, or *spatiotemporal domain*.

NOTE: In other words, a coverage is a feature that has multiple values for each attribute type, where each direct position within the geometric representation of the feature has a single value for each attribute type.

[example]
Examples include a digital image, polygon overlay, or digital elevation matrix

===== Coverage Geometry

Configuration of the *domain* of a *coverage* described in terms of *coordinates*.

===== Direct Position

Position described by a single set of *coordinates* within a *coordinate reference system*.

===== Domain

Well-defined set.

NOTE: Domains are used to define the domain set and range set of attributes, operators, and functions.

===== Depth

The vertical distance from a given water level to the bottom. In this standard, depth refers to the S-32 definition of "Depth Charted".

NOTE: The numbers must be qualified by units and datum. 

===== Feature

Abstraction of real-world phenomena.

NOTE: A feature may occur as a type or an instance. Feature type or feature instance should be used when only one is meant.

===== Feature Attribute

Characteristic of a *feature*.

NOTE: A feature attribute type has a name, a data type, and a domain associated to it. A feature attribute instance has an attribute value taken from the value domain of the feature attribute type.

===== Function

Rule that associates each element from a *domain* (source, or domain of the function) to a unique element in another domain (target, co-domain, or *range*).

NOTE: The range is defined by another domain.

===== Geometric Object

Spatial object representing a set of *direct positions*.

NOTE: A geometric object consists of a geometric primitive, a collection of geometric primitives, or a geometric complex treated as a single entity. A geometric object may be the spatial characteristics of an object such as a feature or a significant part of a feature.

===== Grid

Network composed of two or more sets of curves in which the members of each set intersect the members of the other sets in a systematic way.

NOTE: The curves partition a space into grid cells.

===== Grid Point

Point located at the intersection of two or more curves in a *grid*.

===== Lidar

An optical remote sensing technique that uses a laser pulse to determine distance.

NOTE: Lidar may be used to determine depth in shallow water areas.

===== Navigation Surface

A *coverage* representing the bathymetry and associated uncertainty with the methods by which those objects can be manipulated, combined, and used for a number of tasks, certified for safety of navigation.

===== Range <coverage>

Set of values associated by a *function* with the elements of the *spatiotemporal domain* of a *coverage*.

===== Record

Finite, named collection of related items (objects or values).

NOTE: Logically, a record is a set of pairs <name, item >.

===== Rectified Grid

*Grid* for which there is a linear relationship between the *grid coordinates* and the *coordinates* of an external *coordinate reference system*.

NOTE: If the coordinate reference system is related to the earth by a datum, the grid is a georectified grid.

===== Referenceable Grid

*Grid* associated with a transformation that can be used to convert *grid coordinate* values to values of coordinates referenced to an *external coordinate reference system*.

===== Sonar

A technique that uses sound propagation through water to determine distance, primarily *depth* measurement.

===== Spatiotemporal Domain <coverage>

*Domain* composed of *geometric objects* described in terms of spatial and/or temporal *coordinates*.

NOTE: The spatiotemporal domain of a continuous coverage consists of a set of direct positions defined in relation to a collection of geometric objects.

===== Surface

Connected 2-dimensional geometric primitive, representing the continuous image of a region of a plane.

NOTE: The boundary of a surface is the set of oriented, closed curves that delineate the limits of the surface.

===== Uncertainty

The interval (about a given value) that will contain the true value of the measurement at a specific confidence level.

NOTE: Errors exist and are the differences between the measured value and the true value. Since the true value is never known it follows that the error itself cannot be known. Uncertainty is a statistical assessment of the likely magnitude of this error. The numbers must be qualified by units.

[[itd]]In this document an S-102 uncertainty is always considered to be 1-dimensional and at the 2-sigma or 95% confidence level.[[conlev]]

===== Vector

Quantity having direction as well as magnitude.

NOTE: A directed line segment represents a vector if the length and direction of the line segment are equal to the magnitude and direction of the vector. The term vector data refers to data that represents the spatial configuration of features as a set of directed line segments.

=== General S-122 data product description

*Title*:: Marine Protected Area Product Specification.

*Abstract*:: A Marine Protected Area (MPA) is a protected area whose boundaries
             include an area of the ocean. They include areas of the intertidal or
             sub-tidal terrain, together with their overlying water and associated
             flora, fauna, historical and cultural features, which have been reserved
             by law or other effective means to protect part or all of, the enclosed
             environment. For example, MPAs may be established to protect fish
             species, rare habitat area, or entire ecosystems.
             MPAs can range from, simple declarations to protect a resource, to
             areas that are extensively regulated. The degree to which
             environmental regulations affect shipping varies according to whether
             MPAs are located in territorial waters, exclusive economic zones, or
             high seas. These limits are regulated by the law of the sea. Most
             MPAs are located in the territorial waters of coastal states, where
             enforcement can be ensured. MPAs can also however be established
             in a state's exclusive economic zone and even within international
             waters. For example in 1999, Italy, France and Monaco jointly
             established a cetacean sanctuary in the Ligurian Sea named the
             Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Ma

=== IHO Product Specification Maintenance

==== Introduction
Changes to S-122 will be released by the IHO as a New Edition, revision, or clarification.

==== New Edition
_New Editions_ of S-122 introduce significant changes. _New Editions_ enable new concepts, such as the ability to support new functions or applications, or the introduction of new constructs or data types. _New Editions_ are likely to have a significant impact on either existing users or future users of S-122. All cumulative _revisions_ and _clarifications_ must be included with the release of approved New Editions.

==== Revision
_Revisions_ are defined as substantive semantic changes to S-122. Typically, _revisions_ will change S-122 to correct factual errors; introduce necessary changes that have become evident as a result of practical experience or changing circumstances. A _revision_ must not be classified as a clarification. Revisions could have an impact on either existing users or future users of S-122. All cumulative _clarifications_ must be included with the release of approved _revisions_.

Changes in a revision are minor and ensure backward compatibility with the previous versions within the same Edition. Newer revisions, for example, introduce new features and attributes. Within the same Edition, a dataset of one version could always be processed with a later version of the Feature and Portrayal Catalogues.

In most cases a new feature or portrayal catalogue will result in a _revision_ of S-122.

==== Clarification
_Clarifications_ are non-substantive changes to S-122. Typically, _clarifications_: remove ambiguity; correct grammatical and spelling errors; amend or update cross references; insert improved graphics in spelling, punctuation and grammar. A _clarification_ must not cause any substantive semantic change to S-122.

Changes in a _clarification_ are minor and ensure backward compatibility with the previous versions within the same Edition. Within the same Edition, a dataset of one clarification version could always be processed with a later version of the Feature and Portrayal Catalogues, and a Portrayal Catalogue can always rely on earlier versions of the Feature Catalogue.


==== Version Numbers
The associated version control numbering to identify changes (n) to S-122 must be as follows:

New Editions denoted as **n**.0.0

Revisions denoted as n.**n**.0

Clarifications denoted as n.n.**n**
